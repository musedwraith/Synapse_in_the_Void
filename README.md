# Synapse in the Void

**Synapse in the Void** is a storytelling tool for worldbuilders, writers, and narrative designers.  
It lets you **visualize the relationships between characters** like neurons firing across a dark, dreaming cosmos.

## What It Does

Each **node** is a being in your story — mortal or myth — with the option to display:

- A **written name**
- An **image** (portrait, symbol, or sigil)

- Collects characters
- Collects relationships
- Displays them back to the user
- Uses dynamic memory
- Cleans up memory before exit
- Prevent duplicates
- Edit or Rename Characters

Connections between characters are:

- Threads of **fate**
- Lines of **tension**
- Bonds of **alliance**
- Echoes of **memory**

Together, they form the **web of your world**.
